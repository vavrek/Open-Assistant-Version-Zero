===================================
        If you ever drop your keys into a river of molten lava, let'em
go, because, man, they're gone.

        If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them
own? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason."

        To me, it's a good idea to always carry two sacks of something
when you walk around. That way, if anybody says, "Hey, can you give me a
hand?" You can say, "Sorry, got these sacks."

        One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going
to take my nephew to Disneyland, but instead I drove him to an old
burned-out warehouse. "Oh no," I said, "Disneyland burned down." He cried
and cried, but I think that deep down he thought it was a pretty good
joke. I started to drive over to the real Disneyland, but it was getting
pretty late.

        The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth part of
the face.

        If you lived in the Dark Ages and you were a catapult operator, I
bet the most common question people would ask is, "Can't you make it
shoot farther?" "No, I'm sorry. That's as far as it shoots."

        Is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful, beautiful
flamingo, flying across in front of a beautiful sunset? And he's carrying
a beautiful rose in his beak, and also he's carrying a very beautiful
painting with his feet. And also, you're drunk.

        I believe in making the world safe for our children, but not our
children's children, because I don't think children should be having sex.

        If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to tell
him is, "God is crying." And if he asks why God is crying, another cute
thing to tell him is, "Probably because of something you did."

        If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid seeing yourself in the
mirror, because I bet that's what REALLY throws you into a panic.

        Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my
first instinct is to laugh. But then I think, what if I was an ant and
she fell on me. Then it wouldn't seem quite so funny.

        To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no
choreography and the dancers hit each other.

        I hope if dogs ever take over the world and they choose a king,
they don't just go by size, because I bet there are some Chihuahuas with
some good ideas.

        If life deals you lemons, why not go kill someone with the lemons
(maybe by shoving them down his throat).

        Instead of having "answers" on a math test, they should just call
them "impressions," and if you got a different "impression," so what,
can't we all be brothers?

===================================
        Probably the earliest fly swatters were nothing more than some
sort of striking surface attached to the end of a long stick.

        I wish I would have a real tragic love affair and get so bummed
out that I'd just quit my job and become a bum for a few years, because I
was thinking about doing that anyway.

        I think a good gift for the President would be a chocolate
revolver. And since he's so busy, you'd probably have to run up to him
real quick and hand it to him.

        Maybe in order to understand mankind we have to look at that word
itself. MANKIND. Basically, it's made up of two separate words "mank" and
"ind." What do these words mean? It's a mystery and that's why so is mankind.

        If you go flying back through time and you see somebody else
flying forward into the future, it's probably best to avoid eye contact.

        It's easy to sit there and say you'd like to have more money. And
I guess that's what I like about it. It's easy. Just sitting there,
rocking back and forth, wanting that money.

        If you ever reach total enlightenment while you're drinking a
beer, I bet it makes beer shoot out your nose.

        To me, clowns aren't funny. In fact, they're kinda scary. I've
wondered where this started and I think it goes back to the time I went
to the circus and a clown killed my dad.

        As the light changed from red to green to yellow and back to red
again, I sat there thinking about life. Was it nothing more than a bunch
of honking and yelling? Sometimes it seemed that way.

        I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without
hate. And I can picture us attacking that world, because they'd never
expect it.

        I hope some animal never bores a hole in my head and lays its
eggs in my brain, because later you might think you're having a good idea
but it's just eggs hatching.

        Whenever you read a good book, it's like the author is right
there, in the room talking to you, which is why I don't like to read good
books.

        What is it about a beautiful sunny afternoon, with the birds
singing and the wind rustling through the leaves, that makes you want to
get drunk? And after you're real drunk, maybe go down to the public park
and stagger around and ask people for money, and then lay down and go to
sleep.

        Instead of a trap door, what about a trap window? The guy looks
out it, and if he leans too far, he falls out. Wait. I guess that's like
a regular window.

        During the Middle Ages, probably one of the biggest mistakes was
not putting on your armor because you were "just going down to the corner."

        If I ever get real rich, I hope I'm not real mean to poor people,
like I am now.

        When I found the skull in the woods, the first thing I did was
call the police. But then I got curious about it. I picked it up, and
started wondering who this person was, and why he had deer horns.

        I remember how my great-uncle Jerry would sit on the porch and
whittle all day long. Once he whittled me a toy boat out of a larger toy
boat I had. It was almost as good as the first one, except now it had
bumpy whittle marks all over it. And no paint, because he had whittled
off the paint.

        Here's a good thing to do if you go to a party and you don't know
anybody: First take out the garbage. Then go around and collect any extra
garbage that people might have, like a crumpled napkin, and take that out
too. Pretty soon people will want to meet the busy garbage guy.

                  * MORE DEEP THOUGHTS * 

                      BY JACK HANDY

If they ever come up with a swashbuckling School, I think one of
the courses should be Laughing, Then Jumping Off Something.

When you're riding in a time machine way far into the future,
don't stick your elbow out the window, or it'll turn into a
fossil.

It takes a big man to cry, but it takes a bigger man to laugh at
that man.

At first I thought, if I were Superman, a perfect secret identity
would be "Clark Kent, Dentist," because you could save money on
tooth X-rays. But then I thought, if a patient said, "How's my
back tooth?" and you just looked at it with your X-ray vision and
said, "Oh it's okay," then the patient would probably say,
"Aren't you going to take an X-ray, stupid?" and you'd say, "Aw
fuck you, get outta here," and then he probably wouldn't even pay
his bill.

One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going
to take my little nephew to Disneyland, but instead I drove him
to an old burned-out warehouse. "Oh, no," I said. "Disneyland
burned down." He cried and cried, but I think that deep down, he
thought it was a pretty good joke. I started to drive over to the
real Disneyland, but it was getting pretty late.

A good way to threaten somebody is to light a stick of dynamite.
Then you call the guy and hold the burning fuse up to the phone.
"Hear that?" you say. "That's dynamite, baby."

Why do people in ship mutinies always ask for "better
treatment"? I'd ask for a pinball machine, because with all that
rocking back and forth you'd probably be able to get a lot of
free games.

I'd like to be buried Indian-style, where they put you up on a
high rack, above the ground. That way, you could get hit by
meteorites and not even feel it.

If I lived back in the wild west days, instead of carrying a
six-gun in my holster, I'd carry a soldering iron. That way, if
some smart-aleck cowboy said something like "Hey, look. He's
carrying a soldering iron!" and started laughing, and everybody
else started laughing, I could just say, "That's right, it's a
soldering iron. The soldering iron of justice." Then everybody
would get real quiet and ashamed, because they had made fun of
the soldering iron of justice, and I could probably hit them up
for a free drink.

I bet when the neanderthal kids would make a snowman, someone
would always end up saying, "Don't forget the thick, heavy
brows." Then they would all get embarrassed because they
remembered they had the big hunky brows too, and they'd get mad
and eat the snowman.

Fear can sometimes be a useful emotion. For instance, let's say
you're an astronaught on the moon and you fear that your partner
has been turned into Dracula. The next time he goes out for the
moon pieces, wham!, you just slam the door behind him and blast
off. He might call you on the radio and say he's not Dracula, but
you just say, "Think again, bat man."

Too bad you can't buy a voodoo globe so that you could make the
earth spin real fast and freak everybody out.

The people in the village were real poor, so none of the
children had any toys. But this one little boy had gotten an old
enema bag and filled it with rocks, and he would go around and
whap the other children across the face with it. Man, I think my
heart almost broke. Later the boy came up and offered to give me
the toy. This was too much! I reached out my hand, but then he
ran away. I chased him down and took the enema bag. He cried a
little, but that's the way of these people.

I wish I had a Kryptonite cross, because then you could keep both
Dracula AND Superman away.

I don't think I'm alone when I say I'd like to see more and more
planets fall under the ruthless domination of our solar system.

Dad always thought laughter was the best medicine, which I guess
is why several of us died of tuberculosis.

Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word
itself: "Mankind". Basically, it's made up of two separate words
- "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and
that's why so is mankind.

I hope if dogs ever take over the world, and they chose a king,
they don't just go by size, because I bet there are some
Chihuahuas with some good ideas.

I guess we were all guilty, in a way. We all shot him, we all
skinned him, and we all got a complimentary bumper sticker that
said, "I helped skin Bob."

I bet the main reason the police keep people away from a plane
crash is they don't want anybody walking in and lying down in the
crash stuff, then, when somebody comes up, act like they just
woke up and go, "What was THAT?!"

The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth part of
the face.

Ambition is like a frog sitting on a Venus Flytrap. The flytrap
can bite and bite, but it won't bother the frog because it only
has little tiny plant teeth. But some other stuff could happen
and it could be like ambition.

I'd rather be rich than stupid.

If you were a poor Indian with no weapons, and a bunch of
conquistadors came up to you and asked where the gold was, I
don't think it would be a good idea to say, "I swallowed it. So
sue me."

If you define cowardice as running away at the first sign of
danger, screaming and tripping and begging for mercy, then yes,
Mr. Brave man, I guess I'm a coward.

I bet one legend that keeps recurring throughout history, in
every culture, is the story of Popeye.

When you go in for a job interview, I think a good thing to ask
is if they ever press charges.

To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no
choreography, and the dancers hit each other.

What is it that makes a complete stranger dive into an icy river
to save a solid gold baby? Maybe we'll never know.

We tend to scoff at the beliefs of the ancients. But we can't
scoff at them personally, to their faces, and this is what annoys
me.

Probably the earliest flyswatters were nothing more than some
sort of striking surface attached to the end of a long stick.

I think someone should have had the decency to tell me the
luncheon was free. To make someone run out with potato salad in
his hand, pretending he's throwing up, is not what I call
hospitality.

To me, clowns aren't funny. In fact, they're kind of scary. I've
wondered where this started and I think it goes back to the time
I went to the circus, and a clown killed my dad.

As I bit into the nectarine, it had a crisp juiciness about it
that was very pleasurable - until I realized it wasn't a
nectarine at all, but A HUMAN HEAD!!

Most people don't realize that large pieces of coral, which have
been painted brown and attached to the skull by common wood
screws, can make a child look like a deer.

If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them
down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good
reason.

Better not take a dog on the space shuttle, because if he sticks
his head out when you're coming home his face might burn up.

You know what would make a good story? Something about a clown
who make people happy, but inside he's real sad. Also, he has
severe diarrhea.

Sometimes when I feel like killing someone, I do a little trick
to calm myself down. I'll go over to the persons house and ring
the doorbell. When the person comes to the door, I'm gone, but
you know what I've left on the porch? A jack-o-lantern with a
knife stuck in the side of it's head with a note that says "You."
After that I usually feel a lot better, and no harm done.

If you're a horse, and someone gets on you, and falls off, and
then gets right back on you, I think you should buck him off
right away.

If you ever teach a yodeling class, probably the hardest thing
is to keep the students from just trying to yodel right off. You
see, we build to that.

If you ever fall off the Sears Tower, just go real limp, because
maybe you'll look like a dummy and people will try to catch you
because, hey, free dummy.

I'd like to see a nude opera, because when they hit those high
notes, I bet you can really see it in those genitals.

Anytime I see something screech across a room and latch onto
someones neck, and the guy screams and tries to get it off, I
have to laugh, because what is that thing.

He was a cowboy, mister, and he loved the land. He loved it so
much he made a woman out of dirt and married her. But when he
kissed her, she disintegrated. Later, at the funeral, when the
preacher said, "Dust to dust," some people laughed, and the
cowboy shot them. At his hanging, he told the others, "I'll be
waiting for you in heaven--with a gun."

The memories of my family outings are still a source of strength
to me. I remember we'd all pile into the car - I forget what kind
it was - and drive and drive. I'm not sure where we'd go, but I
think there were some trees there. The smell of something was
strong in the air as we played whatever sport we played. I
remember a bigger, older guy we called "Dad." We'd eat some
stuff, or not, and then I think we went home. I guess some things
never leave you.

If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to
tell him is "God is crying." And if he asks why God is crying,
another cute thing to tell him is "Probably because of something
you did."

Contrary to what most people say, the most dangerous animal in
the world is not the lion or the tiger or even the elephant. It's
a shark riding on an elephant's back, just trampling and eating
everything they see.

As we were driving, we saw a sign that said "Watch for Rocks."
Marta said it should read "Watch for Pretty Rocks." I told her
she should write in her suggestion to the highway department, but
she started saying it was a joke - just to get out of writing a
simple letter! And I thought I was lazy!

One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going
to take my little nephew to DisneyLand, but instead I drove him
to an old burned-out warehouse. "Oh, no," I said, "DisneyLand
burned down." He cried and cried, but I think that deep down he
thought it was a pretty good joke. I started to drive over to the
real DisneyLand, but it was getting pretty late.

If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flippy, which one would you
think liked dolphins the most? I'd say Flippy, wouldn't you?
You'd be wrong, though. It's Hambone.

Laurie got offended that I used the word "puke." But to me,
that's what her dinner tasted like.

We used to laugh at Grandpa when he'd head off and go fishing.
But we wouldn't be laughing that evening when he'd come back with
some whore he picked up in town.

I wish a robot would get elected president. That way, when he
came to town, we could all take a shot at him and not feel too
bad.

As the evening sky faded from a salmon color to a sort of flint
gray, I thought back to the salmon I caught that morning, and how
gray he was, and how I named him Flint.

If you're a young Mafia gangster out on your first date, I bet
it's real embarrassing if someone tries to kill you.

Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my
first instinct is to laugh. But then I think, what is I was an
ant, and she fell on me. Then it wouldn't seem quite so funny.

If you go parachuting, and your parachute doesn't open, and you
friends are all watching you fall, I think a funny gag would be
to pretend you were swimming.

When I was a kid my favorite relative was Uncle Caveman. After
school we'd all go play in his cave, and every once in a while he
would eat one of us. It wasn't until later that I found out that
Uncle Caveman was a bear.

Children need encouragement. If a kid gets an answer right, tell
him it was a lucky guess. That way he develops a good, lucky
feeling.

The crows seemed to be calling his name, thought Caw.

When you die, if you get a choice between going to regular
heaven or pie heaven, choose pie heaven. It might be a trick, but
if it's not, mmmmmmm, boy.

Whether they find a life there or not, I think Jupiter should be
called an enemy planet.

Instead of trying to build newer and bigger weapons of
destruction, we should be thinking about getting more use out of
the ones we already have.

I think a good gift for the President would be a chocolate
revolver. and since he is so busy, you'd probably have to run up
to him real quick and give it to him.

Just because swans mate for life, I don't think its that big a
deal. First of all, if you're a swan, you're probably not going
to find a swan that looks much better than the one you've got, so
why not mate for life?

If you're robbing a bank and you're pants fall down, I think
it's okay to laugh and to let the hostages laugh too, because,
come on, life is funny.

If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid looking in a mirror,
because I bet that will really throw you into a panic.

Sometimes I think I'd be better off dead. No, wait, not me, you.

I can't stand cheap people. It makes me real mad when someone
says something like, "Hey, when are you going to pay me that $100
you owe me?" or "Do you have that $50 you borrowed?" Man, quit
being so cheap!

I think the mistake a lot of us make is thinking the
state-appointed shrink is our friend.

I think one way the cops could make money would be to hold a
murder weapons sale. Many people could really use used ice picks.

If you ever reach total enlightenment while drinking beer, I bet
you could shoot beer out of you nose.

I believe in making the world safe for our children, but not our
children's children, because I don't think children should be
having sex.

Even though I was their captive, the Indians allowed me quite a
bit of freedom. I could walk freely, make my own meals, and even
hurl large rocks at their heads. It was only later that I
discovered that they were not Indians at all but only
dirty-clothes hampers.

I wish outer space guys would conquer the Earth and make people
their pets, because I'd like to have one of those little beds
with my name on it.

It's true that every time you hear a bell, an angel gets its
wings. But what they don't tell you is that every time you hear a
mouse trap snap, and Angel gets set on fire.

If you're in a war, instead of throwing a hand grenade at the
enemy, throw one of those small pumpkins. Maybe it'll make
everyone think how stupid war is, and while they are thinking,
you can throw a real grenade at them.

I hope life isn't a big joke, because I don't get it.

The next time I have meat and mashed potatoes, I think I'll put
a very large blob of potatoes on my plate with just a little
piece of meat. And if someone asks me why I didn't get more meat,
I'll just say, "Oh, you mean this?" and pull out a big piece of
meat from inside the blob of potatoes, where I've hidden it. Good
magic trick, huh?

Life, to me, is like a quiet forest pool, one that needs a
direct hit from a big rock half-buried in the ground. You pull
and you pull, but you can't get the rock out of the ground. So
you give it a good kick, but you lose your balance and go
skidding down the hill toward the pool. Then out comes a big
Hawaiian man who was screwing his wife beside the pool because
they thought it was real pretty. He tells you to get out of
there, but you start faking it, like you're talking Hawaiian, and
then he gets mad and chases you...

Sometimes, when I drive across the desert in the middle of the
night, with no other cars around, I start imagining: What if
there were no civilization out there? No cities, no factories, no
people? And then I think: No people or factories? Then who made
this car? And this highway? And I get so confused I have to stick
my head out the window into the driving rain---unless there's
lightning, because I could get struck on the head by a bolt.

The whole town laughed at my great-grandfather, just because he
worked hard and saved his money. True, working at the hardware
store didn't pay much, but he felt it was better than what
everybody else did, which was go up to the volcano and collect
the gold nuggets it shot out every day. It turned out he was
right. After forty years, the volcano petered out. Everybody left
town, and the hardware store went broke. Finally he decided to
collect gold nuggets too, but there weren't many left by then.
Plus, he broke his leg and the doctor's bills were real high.

Too bad when I was a kid there wasn't a guy in our class that
everybody called the "Cricket Boy", because I would have liked to
stand up in class and tell everybody, "You can make fun of the
Cricket Boy if you want to, but to me he's just like everybody
else." Then everybody would leave the Cricket Boy alone, and I'd
invite him over to spend the night at my house, but after about
five minutes of that loud chirping I'd have to kick him out.
Maybe later we could get up a petition to get the Cricket Family
run out of town. Bye, Cricket Boy.

I think a good product would be "Baby Duck Hat". It's a fake baby
duck, which you strap on top of your head. Then you go swimming
underwater until you find a mommy duck and her babies, and you
join them. Then, all of a sudden, you stand up out of the water
and roar like Godzilla. Man, those ducks really take off! Also,
Baby Duck Hat is good for parties.

I wish I lived back in the old west days, because I'd save up my
money for about twenty years so I could buy a solid-gold pick.
Then I'd go out West and start digging for gold. When someone
came up and asked what I was doing, I'd say, "Looking for gold,
ya durn fool." He'd say, "Your pick is gold," and I'd say, "Well,
that was easy." Good joke, huh.

A funny thing to do is, if you're out hiking and your friend gets
bitten by a poisonous snake, tell him you're going to go for
help, then go about ten feet and pretend that *you* got bit by a
snake. Then start an argument with him about who's going to go
get help. A lot of guys will start crying. That's why it makes
you feel good when you tell them it was just a joke.

I guess I kinda lost control, because in the middle of the play
I ran up and lit the evil puppet villain on fire. No, I didn't.
Just kidding. I just said that to help illustrate one of the human
emotions, which is freaking out. Another emotion is greed, as
when you kill someone for money, or something like that. Another
emotion is generosity, as when you pay someone double what he
paid for his stupid puppet.

Many people think that history is a dull subject. Dull? Is it
"dull" that Jesse James once got bitten on the forehead by an
ant, and at first it didn't seem like anything, but then the bite
got worse and worse, so he went to a doctor in town, and the
secretary told him to wait, so he sat down and waited, and
waited, and waited, and waited, and then finally he got to see
the doctor, and the doctor put some salve on it? You call that
dull?

I scrambled to the top of the precipice where Nick was waiting.
"That was fun," I said. "You bet it was," said Nick. "Let's climb
higher." "No," I said. "I think we should be heading back now."
"We have time," Nick insisted. I said we didn't, and Nick said we
did. We argued back and forth like that for about 20 minutes,
then finally decided to head back. I didn't say it was an
interesting story.

If you're a Thanksgiving dinner, but you don't like the stuffing
or the cranberry sauce or anything else, just pretend like you're
eating it, but instead, put it all in your lap and form it into a
big mushy ball. Then, later, when you're out back having cigars
with the boys, let out a big fake cough and throw the ball to the
ground. Then say, "Boy, these are good cigars!"

I remember that one fateful day when Coach took me aside. I knew
what was coming. "You don't have to tell me," I said. "I'm off
the team, aren't I?" "Well," said Coach, "you never were really
ON the team. You made that uniform you're wearing out of rags and
towels, and your helmet is a toy space helmet. You show up at
practice and then either steal the ball and make us chase you to
get it back, or you try to tackle people at inappropriate times."
It was all true what he was saying. And yet, I thought something
is brewing inside the head of this Coach. He sees something in
me, some kind of raw talent that he can mold. But that's when I
felt the handcuffs go on.

If I ever opened a trampoline store, I don't think I'd call it
Trampo-Land, because you might think it was a store for tramps,
which is not the inpression we are trying to convey with our
store. On the other hand, we would not prohibit tramps from
browsing, or testing the trampolines, unless a tramp's gyrations
seemed to be getting out of control.

I can still recall old Mister Barnslow getting out every morning
and nailing a fresh load of tadpoles to the old board of his.
Then he'd spin it round and round, like a wheel of fortune, and
no matter where it stopped he'd yell out, "Tadpoles! Tadpoles is
a winner!" We all thought he was crazy. But then we had some
growing up to do.

Once when I was in Hawaii, on the island of Kauai, I met a
mysterious old stranger. He said he was about to die and wanted
to tell someone about the treasure. I said, "Okay, as long as
it's not a long story. Some of us have a plane to catch, you
know." He stared telling hes story, about the treasure and his
life and all, and I thought: "This story isn't too long." But
then, he kept going, and I started thinking, "Uh-oh, this story
is getting long." But then the story was over, and I said to
myself: "You know, that story wasn't too long after all." I
forget what the story was about, but there was a good movie on
the plane. It was a little long, though.

I bet a fun thing would be to go way back in time to where there
was going to be an eclipse and tell the cave men, "If I have come
to destroy you, may the sun be blotted out from the sky." Just
then the eclipse would start, and they'd probably try to kill you
or something, but then you could explain about the rotation of
the moon and all, and everyone would get a good laugh.

I wouldn't be surprised if someday some fishermen caught a big
shark and cut it open, and there inside was a whole person. Then
they cut the person open, and in him is a little baby shark. And
in the baby shark there isn't a person, because it would be too
small. But there's a little doll or something, like a Johnny
Combat little toy guy---something like that.
